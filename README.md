# Case Study – Capgemini: Backend System  
**Presentation Script**

---

## Slide 1: Title Slide
**Good morning/afternoon, everyone.**  
Today, I am excited to present my project for the Capgemini case study, focusing on the backend system I developed to solve a real-world business problem.  

---

## Slide 2: Objective & Motivation
**Objective:**  
The goal of this project is to design and implement a scalable backend system that simulates the kinds of applications businesses like Capgemini work with daily.  
**Motivation:**  
I chose this project to deepen my understanding of backend development, industry best practices, and to address challenges commonly faced in enterprise-level systems.

## Slide 3: Real-World Relevance
This project mirrors the workflow and requirements found in consulting and IT companies.  
- Emphasizes robust API design, data management, and security.
- Prepares me for real-world software engineering roles.

---

## Slide 4: Tech Stack & Architecture
**Tech Stack:**
- Programming Language / Framework: (e.g., Node.js with Express)
- Database: (e.g., MongoDB/MySQL)
- Tools: Postman for API testing, GitHub for version control

**Architecture Overview:**  
- Modular codebase
- Organized into routes, controllers, models, and utilities.

---

## Slide 5: Folder Structure
Let’s look at the backend folder structure:
- `/controllers` – Logic for handling requests
- `/models` – Database schemas/models
- `/routes` – API endpoint definitions
- `/utils` – Helper functions/utilities
- `server.js` or `app.js` – Entry point of the backend

---

## Slide 6: Key Features
1. **User Authentication & Authorization:**  
   - Secure login and registration
2. **CRUD APIs:**  
   - Create, Read, Update, Delete operations for main resources
3. **Validation & Error Handling:**  
   - Ensures data integrity and graceful error messages
4. **(Optional) Logging, Environment Configurations, etc.**

---

## Slide 7: Code Walkthrough (Demo)
- **How to Run:**
  1. Clone the repository:  
     `git clone https://github.com/Satwik-Uppada298/Case_Study_Capgemini.git`
  2. Go to the backend directory:  
     `cd Case_Study_Capgemini/Backend`
  3. Install dependencies:  
     `npm install`
  4. Start the server:  
     `npm start`

- **API Example:**  
  Demonstrate a simple API request using Postman or curl.

---

## Slide 8: Challenges & Solutions
- Faced issues with [example: database connection, async code, etc.]
- Solved them by [example: refactoring code, using environment variables, researching best practices]

---

## Slide 9: Best Practices & Learnings  
- Followed RESTful API conventions
- Used modular and maintainable code structure
- Kept configuration and sensitive data secure
- Key learnings: [e.g., async programming, API security, database modeling]

---

## Slide 10: Conclusion & Future Work
- This backend provides a solid foundation for scalable applications.
- In the future, I would like to:
  - Add more advanced features (e.g., role-based access, deployment)
  - Integrate with a frontend
  - Write more extensive tests

---

## Slide 11: Q&A
Thank you for your attention.  
**I’m happy to answer any questions you may have!**
